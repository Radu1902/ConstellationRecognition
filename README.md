Project is pretty self-explanatory via title.

If the stars can be seen clearly in the image (are round, white dots), then in MIGHT just work.
Only a handful of constellations can be detected within images for now, the ones in the templates directory.

HOW DOES IT WORK????

Well in the cases that it DOES, it means that within the image there are white dots detected by opencv's simple blob detector arranged in the shape of one of the constellations in the templates directory (so yes, only one constellation can be detected per image for now).
